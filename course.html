                <p>And now it's gone.</p>

                    <p>I've been collecting quotes for over a decade. Not because I'm particularly wise—I just wanted to avoid forgetting words that mattered.</p>
                    <p>What started as a long note on my iPhone turned into a collection of photos, screenshots, and eventually a digital journal with a complex tagging system. However, I could never find what I needed when I needed it.</p>
                    <p>So I created a system to capture quotes. And then I built an app (Quips) to make it easier to find and surface them.</p>
                    <p>This course shares everything I wish someone had taught me when I started. No theory. No fluff. Just the practical techniques that turned my collection into something genuinely useful.</p>
                    <p><strong>You don't need an app to use these techniques</strong> (though if you want one, I built a good one). You just need 7 days and a willingness to pay attention.</p>

                    <summary>Is this really free?</summary>
                    <p>Yes. Completely free. No ads. No credit card required. I built this to help people, not to sell them something on Day 3. (Though I do mention my app in the final email if you want a tool designed for quote collecting.)</p>

                <details class="course-faq-item">
                    <summary>How much time does it take?</summary>
                    <p>10-20 minutes per day. Each email has one exercise. If you're short on time, you can read the email in 3 minutes and do the exercise later.</p>

                <details class="course-faq-item">
                    <summary>Do I need special tools or apps?</summary>
                    <p>Nope. You can use whatever you already have—notes app, journal, voice memos. The course is platform-agnostic.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="course-faq-item">
                    <summary>I'm not good at organizing. Will this work for me?</summary>
                    <p>That's exactly who this is for. The system I teach is dead simple—5-7 categories max. No complicated filing systems.</p>

                <details class="course-faq-item">
                    <summary>What if I miss a day?</summary>
                    <p>The emails stay in your inbox. You can catch up whenever. There's no deadline.</p>
                </details>
                <details class="course-faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I use this for family quotes, not just famous ones?</summary>
                    <p>Absolutely! In fact, many people find that capturing quotes from family members—especially kids—becomes the most valuable part of their collection. The course covers this extensively.</p>

                <details class="course-faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I unsubscribe?</summary>
                    <p>Of course. There's an unsubscribe link at the bottom of every email. No hard feelings.</p>

                    <summary>Will you sell my email address or spam me after the course?</summary>
                    <p>Nope. After Day 7, you'll only get an occasional email (maybe once a month) with interesting quotes or tips. You can opt out of those too.</p>

                <details class="course-faq-item">
                    <summary>Do you teach how to find good quotes?</summary>
                    <p>Not directly. This course is about capturing, organizing, and using quotes you encounter naturally. It's about developing the habit of paying attention.</p>
